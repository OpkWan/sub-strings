# sub-strings
Question 2

Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. 

It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

Next, make sure your method can handle multiple words:


Question 1

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string:
